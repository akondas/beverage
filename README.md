Caffeinated Beverage is a general support package for the Laravel 5 framework. Beverage provides flexible and reusable components of code for commonly used functionality as well as the means to customize the default Laravel 5 folder structure.

The package follows the FIG standards PSR-1, PSR-2, and PSR-4 to ensure a high level of interoperability between shared PHP code. At the moment the package is not unit tested, but is planned to be covered later down the road.
